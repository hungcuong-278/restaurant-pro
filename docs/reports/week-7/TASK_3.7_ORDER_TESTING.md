### Bugs Found & Fixed

#### Bug #1: Receipt Service Database Column Mismatch ‚úÖ RESOLVED

**Severity:** Critical  
**Impact:** All 3 receipt endpoints returning 500 errors  

**Issues Found:**
1. Query using `tables.table_number` but schema has `tables.number`
2. Query using `order_items.unit_price` but schema has `order_items.item_price`
3. Query using `order_items.subtotal` but schema has `order_items.total_price`
4. Query using `payments.payment_status` but schema has `payments.status`

**Root Cause:**  
Column name mismatches between query and actual database schema defined in migration files.

**Fix Applied:**  
Updated `backend/src/services/receiptService.ts`:
- Line 58: `tables.table_number` ‚Üí `tables.number as table_number`
- Line 77: `order_items.unit_price` ‚Üí `order_items.item_price`
- Line 78: `order_items.subtotal` ‚Üí `order_items.total_price`
- Line 90: `payment_status` ‚Üí `status`

**Verification:**  
- Rebuilt TypeScript (`npm run build`)
- Restarted backend
- Retested API endpoints
- Result: All 3 receipt endpoints now returning 200 OK ‚úÖ

**Commits:**
- `e503600` - Initial fix attempt (incomplete)
- `87d7416` - Complete fix with all column names corrected

#### Known Issue #2: Menu Items Endpoint 404

**Severity:** Minor  
**Status:** Not Critical (Different route path)  
**Description:** Test script using incorrect endpoint path
**Expected Path:** `/restaurants/{id}/menu/items` (based on routes)
**Test Used:** `/restaurants/{id}/menu-items` (incorrect)
**Impact:** Low - Endpoint exists, just wrong path in test
**Action Required:** Update test script or verify correct route
