## 📝 Notes & Observations

### What Worked Well:
- ✅ Test infrastructure setup was smooth
- ✅ Print utility created efficiently
- ✅ Status validation already implemented
- ✅ Kitchen View already has auto-refresh
- ✅ Documentation helps track progress

### Challenges Encountered:
- ⚠️ File encoding issues with automated replacements
- ⚠️ Some test expectations don't match actual service APIs
- ⚠️ Terminal management with multiple processes

### Lessons Learned:
- 💡 Test infrastructure takes time but pays off
- 💡 Good documentation saves time later
- 💡 Status validation prevents bugs
- 💡 Auto-refresh is better than WebSocket for MVP
- 💡 Print feature is essential for restaurants
