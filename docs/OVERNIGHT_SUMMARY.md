## 🚀 Overnight Test Execution

### Test Phases Running:
1. **Phase 1**: Backend Service Unit Tests
2. **Phase 2**: Backend API Integration Tests
3. **Phase 3**: Backend Full Test Suite with Coverage
4. **Phase 4**: Frontend Component Tests
5. **Phase 5**: Database Schema Verification

### Expected Outputs:
- **Log File**: `test-reports/overnight-test-log-[timestamp].txt`
- **Summary Report**: `test-reports/overnight-summary-[timestamp].md`
- **Coverage Reports**:
  - Backend: `backend/coverage/all/lcov-report/index.html`
  - Frontend: `frontend/coverage/lcov-report/index.html`

### Monitoring:
The test suite is running in a minimized PowerShell window. To check status:
```powershell
Get-Process | Where-Object {$_.ProcessName -like '*powershell*'}
```

## 🌅 Morning Review Instructions

### Step 1: View Test Results
Run this command to see the summary:
```powershell
.\view-test-results.ps1
```

This will:
- Display the test summary
- Show pass/fail counts
- Provide quick action links
- Offer to open coverage reports

### Step 2: Review Coverage
The script will help you open:
- Backend coverage: `backend/coverage/all/lcov-report/index.html`
- Frontend coverage: `frontend/coverage/lcov-report/index.html`

### Step 3: Check for Failures
If any tests failed:
1. Review the detailed log file
2. Identify the failing tests
3. Fix the issues
4. Re-run specific test suites:
   ```powershell
   cd backend
   npm test -- --testPathPattern=services
   ```

### Step 4: Coverage Analysis
Target coverage goals:
- Backend Services: **70%+**
- Backend API: **60%+**
- Frontend Components: **65%+**

## 📊 Expected Results

### Best Case Scenario ✅
- All 5 test phases pass
- Coverage meets targets
- No critical issues found
- Ready for deployment

### Likely Scenario ⚠️
- Most tests pass (85-95%)
- Some tests may fail due to:
  - Missing service methods (search, toggle, etc.)
  - Database seeding issues
  - Frontend environment setup
- Coverage: 40-60% (good start, room for improvement)

### Action Items Based on Results:
1. **If all pass**: Focus on increasing coverage and adding E2E tests
2. **If some fail**: Fix failing tests, then re-run
3. **If many fail**: Review test setup and service implementations
